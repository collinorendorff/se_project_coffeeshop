# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, and serves as a single page site for a fictional coffee shop.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plans for improving

- Adding smooth scrolling transition when clicking navigational links at the top of the page
- The site was made for a user on a 1440p screen; improving this would mean more responsive design so that the elements don't appear disorienting on too small/too large screen sizes
